# YTMP3

**YTMP3** is a small project aimed at downloading audio from YouTube videos.
It provides a simple command-line interface to convert a bunch of YouTube URLs from a file into audio files.
All downloaded audio files are saved in `download` directory, relative from project's root directory.

## â›” Limitations

The download queries should not exceed 15 queries (URLs) at the same process. Additionally, it is not stable and might have issues during usage.

## Usage

```bash
node index.js <input-file>
```

> **Note**  
> Make sure the input file is not empty and only contains YouTube URLs.
> Also, ensure that the file does not end with a new line character at the end of the file (EOF),
> as this could lead to errors during URL parsing.

Example of input file:

```
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=<VIDEO_ID>
https://youtu.be/<VIDEO_ID>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<VIDEO_ID>
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=<VIDEO_ID>
```

In example above, each URL has a different pattern:

- `https://m.youtube.com`  
  This YouTube URL is commonly found in the YouTube mobile app. The `m` before youtube is an abbreviation of **mobile**.

- `https://youtu.be`  
  Same as above, it's commonly found in the YouTube mobile app, but the new one.

- `https://www.youtube.com`  
  This YouTube URL is globally used to determine YouTube URLs and supports both mobile and desktop platforms. The `www` itself is an abbreviation of **World Wide Web**.

- `https://music.youtube.com`  
  This YouTube URL is identified as a YouTube Music URL.
